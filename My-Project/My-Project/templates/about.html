    <h2>About AI Interview Analyzer</h2>

    <p>
        AI Interview Analyzer is an intelligent web-based platform designed to transform traditional interview evaluation using
        Artificial Intelligence. The system analyzes interview audio and video data to extract meaningful behavioral and
        communication insights, helping organizations make faster, fairer, and more data-driven hiring decisions.
        
        Modern recruitment processes often rely on subjective human judgment, which can lead to inconsistency and unconscious
        bias. Our platform addresses this challenge by combining Speech Recognition, Machine Learning, and Video Processing
        technologies to objectively evaluate candidate performance during interviews.
        
        Using advanced AI models such as Whisper for speech-to-text conversion, the system converts spoken responses into
        structured text that can be further analyzed for communication quality, engagement level, and behavioral traits. This
        enables recruiters to focus not only on what candidates say, but also how they communicate.
        
        The platform provides a simple and interactive interface where users can upload interview recordings and instantly
        receive transcription results and AI-powered insights. By automating analysis, the system reduces manual effort while
        improving evaluation accuracy and scalability.
